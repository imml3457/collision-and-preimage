# collision-and-preimage
testing a string of x size and running a preimage and collision attack on it.
the size of the string can be truncated in the actual code to fit how many bits you actually want to test.
This is only used as an understanding of how the preimage and collision attack works this should not be used under the pretext of any illicit activites.
